Question 2
Create a program that analyses temperature data collected from multiple weather 
stations in Australia. The data is stored in multiple CSV files under a "temperatures" 
folder, with each file representing data from one year. Process ALL .csv files in the 
temperatures folder. Ignore missing temperature values (NaN) in calculations.
